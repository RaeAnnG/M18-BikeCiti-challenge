## M18 Bike Citi Tableau Challenge
-
This challenge for the New York Citi BikeLinks program is to build a dashboard to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to a webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program and would like a set of data reports to provide the answers.

# Data Analyzed
-
I chose to analyze the data in August in 2021, 2022 and 2023.  When I looked at all the data, it appeared that ridership rose over 20% in 2022 and only dropped slightly in 2023.  However, when I cleaned the data and eliminated all the incomplete data, the data shows that ridership only increased 5% from 2021 to 2022 and decreased 12% in 2023.
Resources Original Folder - includes original uncleaned data for August 2021, 2022 and 2023
Resources Folder - includes data with incomplete data removed for August 2021, 2022 and 2023

*Jersey City classic vs. electric rides - The classic bikes are more popular due to lower cost, short distance trips and/or the additional exercise.
